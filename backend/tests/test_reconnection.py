"""
Tests for reconnection and state recovery:
- Reconnect with same admin_id works
- Rate limit state (may reset on reconnect - verify behavior)
- Room must be rejoined after reconnect

NOTE: Tests involving join_room are skipped because join_room queries
the database for conversation details, which requires a running DB.
