## 4. Deferred / Out-of-Scope

| Item | Status | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Full shadcn generator workflow | Deferred | Current custom CVA system is richer and already integrated |
| Tailwind v3 plugin conventions (`tailwindcss-animate`) | Out-of-scope | Project runs Tailwind v4 CSS-first model |
| Replacing existing `Button` / `Card` / `Badge` | Out-of-scope | Higher current feature richness |
| Backend/WebSocket protocol migration | Out-of-scope | UI-only migration boundary |
