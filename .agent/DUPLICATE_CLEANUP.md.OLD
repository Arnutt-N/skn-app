# 🧹 Duplicate Cleanup Report

> **Date**: 2026-02-13  
> **Action**: Removed duplicate workflows that overlapped with existing ones

---

## ❌ Duplicates Removed

### 1. `workflows/task-summary.md` → ARCHIVED

**Why it was a duplicate:**
- The 5-artifact process was already in `handoff-to-any.md`
- The session summary format was already in `session-summary.md`
- The JSON checkpoint structure was already in `handoff-to-any.md`
- Did not add new value, just combined existing workflows

**Overlaps with:**
| task-summary.md | Existing Workflow |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5-artifact handoff process | `handoff-to-any.md` (Step 2, 3, 4) |
| Session summary template | `session-summary.md` (entire file) |
| JSON checkpoint format | `handoff-to-any.md` (Step 3) |
| task.md updates | `handoff-to-any.md` (Step 2) |

**Kept instead:**
- Use `handoff-to-any.md` for complete handoff process
- Use `session-summary.md` for session summary format
- Both are more focused and complete
