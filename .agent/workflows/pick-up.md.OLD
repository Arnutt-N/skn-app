# Workflow: Agent Pick-Up

## Purpose
Quickly ingest project state and pick up exactly where the last agent left off.

## Steps

### 1. Locate Latest Handover
// turbo
```bash
dir "D:\genAI\skn-app\project-log-md" /O:-D /B
```
*Note: The latest file (usually `handover-*` or `session-summary-*`) is your primary source of truth.*

### 2. Ingest Context
Read the latest log file found in step 1. Pay special attention to:
- **Blockers & Issues**
- **Next Steps for Incoming Agent**

### 3. Sync Task State
Locate and read the latest `task.md`. If you are Antigravity, this is in your artifacts directory. If you are another agent, look in the project root or `.agent/tasks/`.

### 4. Verify Environment
Check current mode (Pro vs Z-AI) using:
`.\secrets\switch-claude.bat status`

### 5. Resume Work
Begin following the "Next Steps" defined in the handover.
