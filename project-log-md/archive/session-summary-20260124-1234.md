# Session Summary: Rich Menu Persistence & UI Consistency Polish
Generated: 2026-01-24 12:34

## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Implement local-first persistence (Draft flow) for Rich Menus to prevent data loss.
- Resovle "Failed to fetch" errors and refine the LINE Credentials settings UX.
- Standardize the Enterprise Git Workflow within the project.
- Polish the Admin Dashboard UI for consistency, specifically the "+ New" action buttons.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Rich Menu Persistence**: Implemented DB model, Alembic migration, and updated the Action Editor to support DRAFT and SYNCED states.
- **LINE Settings Refinement**: 
    - Split "Connect" (Validation) and "Save" (Database) actions.
    - Implemented Modal-based feedback for connection results.
    - Added "Unsaved Changes" protection for the settings form.
- **UI/UX Polish**:
    - Fixed duplicate icons in the "New Menu" button.
    - Standardized all "New" buttons across `rich-menus`, `auto-replies`, and `reply-objects` to use a consistent `+ [Text]` format (removing SVG icons as per preference).
- **Workflow Standardization**: 
    - Updated `git-workflow.md` with Enterprise Security Scans, Tagging (Versioning), and Post-Push Logging.
    - Standardized logging to a single `project-log-md/git-log.md` file.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/rich_menus.py`: Draft/Sync logic.
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/settings.py`: LINE validation endpoint.
- `frontend/app/admin/settings/line/page.tsx`: New split-action UI and Modals.
- `frontend/app/admin/rich-menus/page.tsx`: Duplicate icon fix and button standardizing.
- `frontend/app/admin/auto-replies/page.tsx` & `reply-objects/page.tsx`: Standardized "+" buttons.
- `d:/genAI/skn-app/.agent/workflows/git-workflow.md`: Standardized Git procedures.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions
- **Validation Before Persistence**: Enforced a "Connect" test for LINE credentials before enabling the "Save" button to ensure only working tokens are stored.
- **Single Log Tracking**: Switched from multiple timestamped log files to a single `git-log.md` for cleaner project history tracking.
- **Visual Consistency**: Standardized primary action buttons to a simple `+` text prefix without SVG icons to achieve a cleaner look across the dashboard.

## ⏳ Next Steps
- Perform live verification of the Rich Menu image upload and sync flow.
- Monitor `project-log-md/git-log.md` after each push to ensure history is correctly tracked.

## 📋 Context for New Chat
- The latest commit status is available in `D:/genAI/skn-app/project-log-md/git-log.md`.
- All "New" action buttons should follow the `+ [Label]` text pattern (no SVG).
- LINE credentials management is now "Verify then Save".
