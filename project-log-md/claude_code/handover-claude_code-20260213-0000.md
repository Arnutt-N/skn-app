- This session was a state-sync handover only (no code changes).

## Technical Context
- No active servers or processes from this session.
- All state files have been reconciled and synced.
- Latest commit: `43300a9 fix(live-chat): resolve real-time messaging, infinite spinner, and UI spacing`
- Many uncommitted changes exist (see `git status`).

## Instructions for Successor
1. Read this handover file and `.agent/state/task.md` for full context.
2. Pick up **Step 1.8** (session claim race condition) as highest priority.
3. Then **Step 1.10** (FCR O(n) optimization).
4. Run `npm run lint && npm run build` in frontend to verify build gate.
5. At handoff, update all 5 mandatory artifacts per the sync contract in `task.md`.
