# Session Summary: CodeX Audit + Project Status Consolidation

**Agent**: Claude Code (claude-opus-4.6)
**Date**: 2026-02-08
**Time**: 22:30
**Status**: COMPLETED

---

## Objectives

1. Perform universal pickup from CodeX and Kimi Code handoffs
2. Update project state files (current-session.json, task.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md)
3. Conduct comprehensive audit of all CodeX work across backend and frontend
4. Generate detailed audit report with severity-ranked issues

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Read latest handoff checkpoints (CodeX 2026-02-09 00:27, Kimi Code 2026-02-08 12:37)
- [x] Updated `current-session.json` — Claude Code as active agent with full plan progress
- [x] Updated `task.md` — 9/27 steps complete across all 4 phases with attribution
- [x] Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — Phase 7 progress consolidated from all agents
- [x] Launched parallel backend + frontend audit agents
- [x] Reviewed 24+ files modified by CodeX
- [x] Generated comprehensive audit report with 22 issues

## Key Findings

| Area | Score | Issues Found |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Backend Logic | 7/10 | 3 (Redis fallback good, type/error handling gaps) |
| Backend Tests | 3/10 | 2 (wrong API, fake stubs) |
| Database Migrations | 6/10 | 2 (not idempotent) |
| Frontend Security | 4/10 | 3 (no auth headers, XSS, no error boundaries) |
| Frontend UX | 7/10 | 5 (missing loading/error states, a11y gaps) |
| Frontend Types | 6/10 | 2 (import paths, type safety) |

### Issue Summary: 22 Total

| Severity | Count | Key Examples |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Critical | 3 | Broken tests (pytest API), missing auth headers (6 files), non-idempotent migration |
| High | 6 | FakeRedis stubs useless, SQLAlchemy overlaps, no error boundaries, XSS risk |
| Medium | 8 | Redis error handling, race conditions, keyboard nav, missing validation |
| Low | 5 | Magic numbers, incomplete tests, generic errors |

### Positive CodeX Work
- Redis fallback to local state well-implemented
- Server-scoped WebSocket architecture correct
- Component decomposition of live-chat clean
- Frontend lint 0 errors, production build passes
- Media persistence with proper error handling

## Deliverables

| File | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Audit Report | `research/claude_code/codex-audit-report-20260209-claude-code.md` | 22 issues, priority fix order |
| Session State | `.agent/state/current-session.json` | Claude Code active, full plan tracking |
| Task File | `.agent/state/task.md` | 9/27 steps, all phases tracked |
| Handoff | `.agent/state/checkpoints/handover-claude_code-any-20260208-2200.json` | Full handoff checkpoint |

## Plan Progress (27-Step Plan)

| Phase | Complete | Remaining | Done By |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Phase 1: Security | 3/10 | 7 | Claude Code (1.1, 1.3), CodeX (1.9) |
| Phase 2: Core UX | 2/7 | 5 | CodeX (2.2, 2.7) |
| Phase 3: Features | 2/7 | 5 | CodeX (3.1, 3.2) |
| Phase 4: Scaling | 2/7 | 5 | CodeX (4.1, 4.7) |
| **Total** | **9/27 (33%)** | **18** | |
