# Session Summary: Admin Media Contract Fix + Universal Handoff

Generated: 2026-03-15T17:18:30.9947907+07:00  
Agent: CodeX (Codex GPT-5)  
Branch: `feat/ui-workflow-audit`

## Objective
Repair the `/admin/files` media API contract so the new admin files browser can actually list and delete media, then execute the universal handoff workflow with synchronized cross-platform artifacts.

## Cross-Platform Context

### Summaries Read (Before My Work)
- [CodeX] `session-summary-20260315-1542.md` - branch already contains commit `2f06695` with admin auth/menu/role guard fixes.
- [Claude Code] `session-summary-20260315-1730.md` - uncommitted UI overhaul introduced the `/admin/files` browser and semantic-token updates.
- [Open Code] `session-summary-20260214-2300.md` - live-chat migration planning remains broader reference context.
- [Kimi Code] `session-summary-20260214-1325.md` - cross-platform handoff/index rules are mandatory.

### For Next Agent
**You should read these summaries before continuing:**
1. [Claude Code] `session-summary-20260315-1730.md` - explains the wider UI overhaul that this media fix now complements.
2. [CodeX] `session-summary-20260315-1718.md` - this handoff; explains the backend/frontend media contract repair and current verification state.
3. [Kimi Code] `session-summary-20260214-1325.md` - workflow/index rules if you need to continue cross-platform bookkeeping.

**Current project state across platforms:**
- CodeX: branch `feat/ui-workflow-audit` now has admin workflow fixes in commit `2f06695` plus a working media list/delete contract in the dirty worktree.
- Claude Code: UI overhaul and skills-audit changes remain uncommitted in the same worktree.
- Open Code/Kimi Code: prior planning and workflow standards remain reference context.

## Completed
- Reviewed the uncommitted diff and confirmed the two review findings on `/admin/files`:
  - `GET /api/v1/media` list route did not exist
  - `DELETE /api/v1/media/{id}` delete route did not exist
- Updated backend media endpoints in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/media.py`:
  - kept public `POST /api/v1/media` and `GET /api/v1/media/{media_id}`
  - added authenticated `GET /api/v1/admin/media`
  - added authenticated `DELETE /api/v1/admin/media/{media_id}`
- Added `backend/app/schemas/media.py` so the admin page receives a stable response shape:
  - `id`
  - `file_name`
  - `content_type`
  - `size`
  - `created_at`
- Updated `frontend/app/admin/files/page.tsx`:
  - list/delete now use `/api/v1/admin/media`
  - upload/download still use `/api/v1/media`
  - delete now checks `res.ok` and reports failures instead of silently refetching
- Added focused backend tests in `backend/tests/test_media_endpoints.py`.
- Ran verification:
  - `python -m pytest tests/test_media_endpoints.py -q`
  - `npm run lint -- app/admin/files/page.tsx`
  - `npm run build`
- Executed the universal handoff workflow and synchronized the required state artifacts.

## In Progress
- No WSL runtime smoke test was run in this session; `/admin/files` still needs one full browser pass with real backend/frontend servers.
- The worktree remains dirty with Claude UI overhaul changes, Claude skill updates, and this CodeX media fix mixed together.

## Blockers
- None. Shared handoff state was reconciled after confirming Claude's 19:00 checkpoint and session summary are present in the worktree.

## Next Steps
1. Run the WSL smoke test for `/admin/files`: upload -> list -> download -> delete.
2. Decide the intended commit scope for the current dirty tree before staging anything.
3. Review Claude Task #24 skills-audit summary if the next task touches auth, settings, or design-system skills.
4. Commit intended changes on `feat/ui-workflow-audit` and open/update the PR to `main`.
