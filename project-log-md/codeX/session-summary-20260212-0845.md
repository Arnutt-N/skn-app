# Session Summary: codex

## What was done
- Completed pickup workflow and reconciled state drift in `.agent/state/current-session.json` (14/27 -> 18/27).
- Built and merged frontend design-system baseline from screenshot references and research spec.
- Added `/admin/design-system` page and menu entry.
- Added unified docs and compliance checklist.
- Extracted reusable admin components: `AdminSearchFilterBar`, `AdminTableHead`, and `components/admin` barrel.
- Adopted shared patterns across `requests`, `friends`, `auto-replies`, and `rich-menus`.
- Applied Thai readability, uppercase policy cleanup, and focus-ring consistency across live-chat/admin surfaces.
- Fixed hydration mismatch in `frontend/components/ui/Toast.tsx` by mount-gating portal render.
- Fixed lint/build blockers in shared provider/UI files.

## Validation
- `python .agent/scripts/validate_handoff_state.py`: PASS
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS

## Branch

## Next

2. Normalize imports to `@/components/admin` barrel.
3. Add visual regression checklist/screenshot flow for core admin pages.
