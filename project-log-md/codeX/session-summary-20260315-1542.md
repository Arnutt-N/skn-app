# Session Summary: Admin Workflow Audit + Role/Menu Guard Handoff

Generated: 2026-03-15T15:42:05+07:00  
Agent: CodeX (Codex GPT-5)  
Branch: `feat/ui-workflow-audit`

## Objective
Audit admin workflow coverage, repair broken auth/menu/role behavior, and hand off the feature branch with synchronized cross-platform artifacts.

## Cross-Platform Context

### Summaries Read (Before My Work)
- [Claude Code] `session-summary-20260220-2220.md` - v1.8.0 UI baseline on `main`, semantic-token admin UI complete.
- [Open Code] `session-summary-20260214-2300.md` - live-chat migration planning and phased implementation context.
- [Kimi Code] `session-summary-20260214-1325.md` - cross-platform handoff/index requirements.
- [CodeX] `session-summary-20260215-1848.md` - prior universal handoff artifact pattern.

### For Next Agent
**You should read these summaries before continuing:**
1. [Claude Code] `session-summary-20260220-2220.md` - stable UI baseline currently on `main`.
2. [CodeX] `session-summary-20260315-1542.md` - this branch’s workflow/auth/menu guard changes and remaining dirty-file notes.
3. [Open Code] `session-summary-20260214-2300.md` - live-chat migration rationale if redesign scope touches that area.

**Current project state across platforms:**
- Claude Code: last stable merged UI milestone is v1.8.0 on `main`.
- CodeX: current active branch is `feat/ui-workflow-audit` with admin workflow hardening commit `2f06695`.
- Kimi/Open Code: workflow system and migration-planning context remain relevant reference material.

## Completed
- Audited the admin shell and identified four primary workflow failures:
  - browser admin fetches were inconsistent about sending bearer tokens
  - sidebar contained dead links and an orphaned LINE settings flow
  - AGENT users could authenticate but then hit mismatched UI/backend authorization behavior
  - some restricted pages needed explicit client-side role guards
- Implemented centralized admin bearer propagation:
  - `frontend/lib/authFetch.ts`
  - `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Repaired sidebar/settings mapping:
  - removed dead links
  - remapped settings to `/admin/settings/line`
  - redirected `/admin/settings` to the LINE settings page
- Aligned AGENT backend/frontend access:
  - added `get_current_staff` in `backend/app/api/deps.py`
  - moved live-chat staff actions in `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/admin_live_chat.py` to the staff dependency
  - kept analytics admin-only
- Added route/page protection:
  - `frontend/components/admin/PageAccessGuard.tsx`
  - role-aware filtering/redirect behavior in `frontend/app/admin/layout.tsx`
  - client-side guards for `frontend/app/admin/page.tsx`, `frontend/app/admin/chatbot/page.tsx`, and `frontend/app/admin/design-system/page.tsx`
- Committed and pushed:
  - branch: `feat/ui-workflow-audit`
  - commit: `2f06695`
  - message: `fix(admin): align role access and guard restricted routes`

## In Progress
- UI redesign and deeper workflow audit across remaining admin routes are not complete.
- The worktree still has unrelated local changes that were intentionally left out of commit `2f06695`.

## Blockers
- Whole-project frontend verification (`lint`, `tsc --noEmit`, and build) was not completed during this session because the environment timed out on full-project runs.
- Unrelated local modifications remain in the working tree and need explicit triage before PR/opening merge review.

## Next Steps
1. Continue redesign and workflow review on `feat/ui-workflow-audit`.
2. Decide whether to incorporate or discard the unrelated dirty frontend files before the branch is reviewed.
3. Extend page-level guard coverage if additional restricted routes are found.
4. Run full frontend validation once environment stability allows completion.
