# Session Summary: State Reconciliation and Handoff Workflow Hardening

**Agent**: CodeX  
**Date**: 2026-02-10  
**Time**: 21:15 (+07:00)  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Objective
Fix stale cross-file state and enforce a strict cross-platform handoff contract.

## Completed
- Reconciled `.agent/state/current-session.json` to latest known completion context.
- Reconciled `.agent/state/task.md` with consistent phase/step counts.
- Rebuilt `.agent/PROJECT_STATUS.md` into a coherent, contradiction-free status board.
- Replaced pickup/handoff workflows with strict sync-gate versions.
- Replaced prompt template with mandatory 5-artifact output contract.
- Updated collaboration skills with explicit state consistency rules.
- Created a fresh handoff checkpoint for this reconciliation session.

## In Progress
- Remaining Phase 7 implementation work (Step 1.8, Step 1.10, frontend gate).

## Blockers
- None.

## Next Steps
1. Implement Step 1.8 (session claim race condition).
2. Implement Step 1.10 (FCR performance fix).
3. Re-run frontend lint/build and clear remaining failures.
4. Keep all three state files synchronized during every handoff.
