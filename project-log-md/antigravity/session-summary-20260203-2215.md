## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Provide accurate commands for running Backend and Frontend in WSL.
- Fix WebSocket connections for Live Chat functionality.
- Resolve database schema mismatches causing backend crashes.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Defined split terminal commands for running Backend (FastAPI) and Frontend (Next.js) in WSL.
- [x] Fixed 'Message' object attribute error by adding `sender_role` and `operator_name` columns to `models/message.py`.
- [x] Created `SenderRole` Enum in SQLAlchemy model.
- [x] Guided manual fix for PostgreSQL Enum type creation (`CREATE TYPE senderrole ...`).
- [x] Verified Kimi Code access to `.agent/skills`.

## ⚡ Technical State & Decisions
- **Mode**: Execution
- **Modified**: `backend/app/models/message.py`
- **Database**: Added columns `sender_role` (Enum) and `operator_name` (String) to `messages` table.
- **Critical Info**: When applying migrations involving new Enums in AsyncPG/SQLAlchemy, specifically for `sender_role`, the type had to be created manually in the DB first before the Alembic migration could succeed.

## ⏳ Next Steps / Handover
- Ensure the application is running smoothly with the new schema.
- Monitor `ws_live_chat.py` for any further attribute errors.
- Continue with Live Chat UI refinement if needed.
