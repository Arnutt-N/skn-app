## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Troubleshoot `Permission denied` error during `npx ctx7 skills install`.
- Verify installation of `frontend-design` skill in both `.claude` and `.agent` directories.
- Analyze potential conflicts between `frontend-design`, `senior-frontend`, and `nextjs_enterprise` skills.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Diagnosed `Permission denied` error as a result of running `npx` in Windows CMD instead of WSL (or without Admin rights).
- [x] Confirmed `frontend-design` skill exists in `.claude/skills`.
- [x] Attempted to sync `frontend-design` to `.agent/skills` (blocked by permissions on a corrupted `senior-frontend` file).
- [x] Analyzed skills for conflicts: Found that `frontend-design` (Aesthetics), `senior-frontend` (Tools), and `nextjs_enterprise` (Structure) are complementary and do not conflict.
- [x] Verified `frontend-design` skill *actually exists* in `.agent/skills` (likely from a successful partial copy or prior state), resolving the confusion.

## ⚡ Technical State & Decisions
- **System**: Windows + WSL2.
- **Issue**: A 0-byte/corrupted file named `senior-frontend` existed in `.agent/skills`, causing confusion with the folder of the same name.
- **Resolution**:
    - Users should use WSL for all skill installations to avoid permission issues.
    - `frontend-design` is available for use.
    - `senior-frontend` (the valid tool skill) is available in `.agent/skills/senior-frontend`.

## ⏳ Next Steps / Handover
- If the corrupted 0-byte `senior-frontend` file persists in `.agent/skills`, the user needs to run `rm -rf` from WSL to clear it.
- **Ready to use**: The user can now proceed with frontend development using the "Creative" direction from `frontend-design` and the "Structural" rules from `nextjs_enterprise`.
