## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Fix WebSocket serialization issue (SenderRole/ChatMode Enums).
- Investigate and fix Backend startup failure in WSL (ModuleNotFoundError).
- Address `venv_linux` corruption reported by Kimi Code CLI.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified and fixed Enum serialization in `ws_live_chat.py`.
- [x] Verified fix with `verify_serialization.py`.
- [x] Started rebuilding `venv_linux` to resolve CRLF corruption.
- [x] Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with serialization fix.

## ⚡ Technical State & Decisions
- **Mode**: Pro (Antigravity)
- **Modified**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/ws_live_chat.py`, `.agent/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
- **Decision**: Recommended rebuilding the virtual environment in WSL (LF) instead of switching to Windows (CRLF) to maintain development standards.

## ⏳ Next Steps / Handover
- Complete dependency installation in fresh `venv_linux`.
- Verify the new Phase 4 Analytics and Audit features (KPIs).
- Ensure Redis server is active and accessible from the new environment.
- Run `npm run dev` in frontend and verify connection to backend.
