## Completed Tasks

### 1. Template Screenshot Analysis
- **Location**: `D:\genAI\skn-app\examples\templates\`
- **Files Analyzed**: 105 screenshots from Vuexy Vue.js Admin Template v3
- **Categories Reviewed**:
  - Dashboards (Analytics, CRM, Ecommerce, Academy, Logistics)
  - Apps (Calendar, Chat, Email, Invoice, Kanban, User Management)
  - Components (Alerts, Badges, Buttons, Cards, Chips, Dialogs, Tabs)
  - Forms (Inputs, Layouts, Wizards, Validation)
  - Tables (Data tables, pagination)
  - Authentication (Login, Register, Error pages)

### 2. UI Design System Creation
- **Output**: `/research/kimi_code/ui_design_system.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive design system document including:
  - Color palette with hex codes and semantic tokens
  - Typography scale adapted for Thai language
  - Spacing system and border radius
  - Shadows and elevation tokens
  - 18 component specifications (Buttons, Cards, Forms, Tables, etc.)
  - Layout patterns for dashboard grid
  - Chart and data visualization guidelines
  - Authentication and error page patterns
  - Animation and transition specifications
  - Responsive breakpoints
  - Accessibility guidelines

### 3. Thai Language Adaptation
- Font: Noto Sans Thai (Google Fonts)
- Minimum body text: 16px (increased from 14px)
- Line height: 1.5-1.7 for Thai readability
- Removed text-transform: uppercase (Thai has no case)
- Added word-break: keep-all for proper Thai word wrapping

### 4. Lucide Icon Integration
- Updated all component examples to use Lucide React
- Added icon sizing guidelines (xs: 14px to 2xl: 48px)
- Included stroke width recommendations
- Created icon reference appendix by category

### 5. Project UI Analysis
- **Output**: `/research/kimi_code/ui_analysis_report.md`
- **Framework Analyzed**: Next.js 16.1 + React 19.2 + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Grade**: B+ overall
- **Key Findings**:
  - Excellent Thai font integration (A)
  - Consistent Lucide icon usage (A)
  - Needs CVA for component variants
  - Missing accessibility features (focus rings, ARIA)
  - No dark mode implementation
  - Large components need refactoring

## Technical Stack Documented

- **Font**: Noto Sans Thai (Google Fonts)

## Next Steps for Next Agent

### Immediate Actions
1. Review the UI Analysis Report for specific code issues
2. Prioritize accessibility fixes (focus rings, ARIA labels)
3. Implement CVA (class-variance-authority) for component standardization
4. Add dark mode CSS variables and ThemeProvider

### Component Refactoring Priority
1. `frontend/components/ui/Button.tsx` - Add forwardRef, CVA
2. `frontend/components/ui/Modal.tsx` - Add focus trap, ESC handler
3. `frontend/app/admin/live-chat/page.tsx` - Split into smaller components
4. `frontend/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Replace inline SVGs with Lucide icons

### Installation Commands
```bash
npm install class-variance-authority
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog  # For accessible modal primitives
```

## Handoff Notes

- All template screenshots have been analyzed and documented
- Design system is ready for implementation reference
- Project has good foundations but needs architectural improvements
- Thai language support is excellent and should be maintained
- Lucide icons are consistently used and should continue

**Status**: Ready for next phase of implementation and refactoring.
