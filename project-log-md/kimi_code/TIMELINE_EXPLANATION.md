## 📁 Files with Timestamps

### Session Summary (Analysis Phase)
- **File:** `session-summary-2026-02-07-2130.md`
- **Timestamp:** 21:30 PM
- **Represents:** When analysis work started/completed
- **Why 21:30?** User requested analysis at this time

### Handoff Document (Handoff Phase)
- **File:** `HANDOFF-20260207-2230.md` (filename)
- **Timestamp:** 23:57 PM (updated inside)
- **Represents:** When handoff was actually completed
- **Note:** Filename kept as 2230 for consistency, content updated to 2357

## ✅ Correct Approach

Per `.agent/AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`:

1. **Analysis Phase** → Create session summary with analysis timestamp (21:30) ✅
2. **Handoff Phase** → Create handoff document with actual handoff time (23:57) ✅

The session summary reflects the **work completion time** (21:30).  
The handoff document reflects the **actual handoff time** (23:57).

---

## 🎯 Key Point

**Session summaries can have different timestamps than handoff times** because:
- Analysis may take hours
- Multiple iterations may occur
- Handoff happens when work is fully wrapped up

Both timestamps are accurate for their respective phases.
