## Issues Addressed

### WSL/npm Platform Compatibility
**Problem:** User tried to run `npm install` in WSL but node_modules contained Windows-specific package (`@tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc`).

**Root Cause:** Tailwind CSS v4 uses platform-specific native binaries. Windows packages don't work in WSL (Linux).

**Solution:** Clean reinstall in WSL:
```bash
cd ~/projects/skn-app/frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps (From Previous Handoff)

1. **Step 1.8:** Fix session claim race condition
2. **Step 1.10:** Fix FCR O(n) calculation
3. Fix pre-existing TS errors in Checkbox.tsx, ModalAlert.tsx, Toast.tsx
