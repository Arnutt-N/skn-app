## 🎯 For Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time on This Project

```
I'm starting fresh on the SknApp project. Please:

1. Read the project overview from .agent/PROJECT_STATUS.md
2. Understand the tech stack: FastAPI + Next.js 16 + PostgreSQL + Redis
3. Read the collaboration standards: .agent/skills/cross_platform_collaboration/SKILL.md
4. Check if there's any pending work:
   - List files in project-log-md/*/
   - Check .agent/state/task.md
   - Check .agent/state/current-session.json

5. If this is a NEW task (not continuing previous work):
   - Create a new task.md with the objective
   - Initialize current-session.json
   - Start working

6. If this is CONTINUING previous work:
   - Follow .agent/workflows/pickup-from-any.md
   - Read the latest handover/session-summary
   - Update session ownership
   - Continue work

Report back:
- What is the current project status?
- What task should I work on?
- Are there any blockers?
```

### Scenario 2: Picking Up From Previous Agent

```
I'm picking up work from a previous agent on the SknApp project.

STEPS TO FOLLOW:

1. Read .agent/workflows/pickup-from-any.md completely

2. Locate latest handoff:
   ```bash
   ls -la .agent/state/checkpoints/handover-*.json | head -5
   ls -la project-log-md/*/session-summary-*.md | head -5
   ```

3. Read all state files:
   - .agent/state/current-session.json
   - .agent/state/task.md
   - .agent/PROJECT_STATUS.md
   - Latest handover JSON
   - Latest session summary MD

4. Validate consistency:
   - Does git branch match current-session.json?
   - Are task counters aligned?
   - Is there any stale state?

5. Update for your platform:
   - Update current-session.json with:
     * Your platform (claude-code/kimi_code/codex/etc.)
     * New session_id
     * Current timestamp
     * Your agent_id

6. Confirm understanding:
   - What was completed?
   - What is in progress?
   - What are the next steps?
   - Any blockers?

7. Begin work on the first next action

Report back your understanding before starting implementation.
```

### Scenario 3: Handing Off to Next Agent

```
I'm finishing work and need to hand off to the next agent on SknApp project.

STEPS TO FOLLOW:

1. Read .agent/workflows/handoff-to-any.md completely

2. Complete the Mandatory 5-Artifact Handoff:

   Artifact 1: Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
   - Add timestamp to "Last Updated"
   - Mark completed tasks in Active Milestones
   - Add entry to Recent Completions
   - Update Thai summary

   Artifact 2: Update current-session.json
   - Set status to "completed" or "in_progress"
   - Update last_updated timestamp
   - List all modified files
   - Add next_steps

   Artifact 3: Update task.md
   - Check off completed subtasks
   - Update progress notes
   - List any blockers
   - Specify next steps

   Artifact 4: Create handover checkpoint
   - File: .agent/state/checkpoints/handover-[YOUR_PLATFORM]-[TIMESTAMP].json
   - Include: summary, completed, in_progress, next_actions, blockers

   Artifact 5: Create session summary
   - File: project-log-md/[YOUR_PLATFORM]/session-summary-[TIMESTAMP].md
   - Include: Completed, In Progress, Next Steps (English + Thai)

3. Verify all artifacts:
   ```bash
   cat .agent/PROJECT_STATUS.md | head -20
   cat .agent/state/current-session.json
   cat .agent/state/task.md
   ls -la .agent/state/checkpoints/
   ```

4. Final handoff message:
   - State what was accomplished
   - List specific next actions
   - Note any blockers or warnings
   - Specify which agent should pick up next (if known)

Report: "Handoff complete, all 5 artifacts created"
```

### Scenario 4: Working on Specific Feature

```
I need to work on [FEATURE_NAME] for the SknApp project.

CONTEXT:
- Project: SknApp (LINE Chatbot with LIFF)
- Tech: FastAPI + Next.js 16 + PostgreSQL + Redis
- Feature: [DESCRIBE_FEATURE]

RESEARCH PHASE:
1. Check .agent/INDEX.md for relevant skills:
   - Backend? → fastapi_enterprise, api_development_standard
   - Frontend? → nextjs_enterprise, frontend_architecture
   - LINE? → line_integration, line_messaging_advanced
   - Database? → database_postgresql_standard

2. Check PRPs/ directory for existing proposals

3. Check if similar work exists:
   - Search project-log-md/ for related tasks
   - Check research/ for analysis

PLANNING PHASE:
4. Read relevant SKILL.md files completely

5. Create a plan following the skill's patterns

6. Update task.md with:
   - Objective
   - Subtasks
   - Dependencies

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:
7. Follow the skill's coding standards
8. Update progress in task.md regularly
9. Test according to testing_standards skill

Report progress every 30 minutes or at milestones.
```

### For Any Platform
- All platforms read/write the SAME files
- Use JSON for machine-readable state
- Use Markdown for human-readable docs
- Follow the same directory structure

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

1. **ALWAYS read PROJECT_STATUS.md first**
   - This is the single source of truth
   - Updated by every agent at end of session

2. **ALWAYS follow handoff-to-any.md when ending**
   - 5 artifacts are MANDATORY
   - Incomplete handoff = invalid handoff

3. **ALWAYS follow pickup-from-any.md when starting**
   - Validate state consistency
   - Don't start work until state is coherent

4. **NEVER modify locked files**
   - Check current-session.json for locked_files
   - Wait for other agents to complete

5. **ALWAYS update task.md progress**
   - Check off completed subtasks
   - Add progress notes
   - Note any blockers

---

## 📞 EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If something goes wrong:

1. **Check git history**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   git log -- .agent/state/ --oneline
   ```

2. **Check for checkpoints**
   ```bash
   ls -lt .agent/state/checkpoints/
   ```

3. **Reconstruct from latest checkpoint**
   - Read latest handover JSON
   - Read matching session summary
   - Reset to that state if needed

4. **Document the issue**
   - Add to PROJECT_STATUS.md under "Issues"
   - Create issue file in project-log-md/
